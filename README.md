This project is a classic Snake Game app made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder. Main features I learned and build while developing this project:

- working with XAML files
- working with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- using async methods
- working with "awaits" and getters
- drawing grid views using code 
- using dictionaries
